1.2a (2.12.2023)

* Fixed CRCs of interrupted INIR and INDR instructions in MEMPTR test. Thanks to redcode.

1.2 (26.1.2022)

* Added test to reveal random behavior of bits 5 and 3 after CCF on real machines.

1.1a (17.1.2022)

* Aligned the test to fixed address so minor changes in the main loop don't affect the CRCs.

1.1 (16.1.2022)

+ Added variants of SCF and CCF tests for Z80 CPUs made by NEC and ST (SGS+Thomson).
+ Added tests for LDxR and INxR block instructions which overwrite itself.
+ Avoid and report any IN related tests if the IN(0xFE) value doesn't match the expected one.
* Fixed INDR test to really test INDR, not INIR.

1.0 (7.12.2012)

+ First release.
